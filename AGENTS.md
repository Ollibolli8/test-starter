## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Working rules for this timed client test

Read by every agent (Claude through CLAUDE.md, Codex directly). Read `HANDOFF.md` first and update it at the end of every job.

Commands: `npm run dev` (local server), `npm run check` (typecheck, lint, test, build). Run `npm run check` before every commit and fix what it reports; never commit red. GitHub runs the same check on every push.

### Stack (fixed)

- Next.js App Router, TypeScript in strict mode (with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), Tailwind CSS, Motion (`motion/react`), Lenis.
- No other UI, component, animation or state libraries unless the brief needs one. If you add one, write why as a line in README → Decisions.
- Tailwind 4 runs through `@tailwindcss/turbopack` in `next.config.ts` (there is no PostCSS config and no `tailwind.config`). Tokens live in `app/globals.css`; use them (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted`, `border-border`, `bg-accent`, `text-display`, `ease-out-soft`) instead of new hex values or one-off sizes.
- In this Next.js version `error.tsx` gets `{ error, retry }` (type `ErrorInfo` from `next/error`); call `retry()`, not `reset()`. `LayoutProps` and `PageProps` are global types made by `next typegen`, which `npm run typecheck` runs first.

### Code

- Small typed components with clear names, one job each. Pages compose them. Shared pieces in `components/`, logic in `lib/`.
- No `any`. Use `unknown` and narrow it, or write the type.
- Data comes through one typed interface, so a simulated source can be swapped for a real one in one place: types in `lib/data/types.ts`, the interface in `lib/data/source.ts`, the simulated source in `lib/data/simulated.ts`. Components import from the interface, never from the simulated source.
- Pure logic goes in `lib/` with a test next to it (`*.test.ts`, Vitest). `lib/cart/cart.ts` and its test show the pattern.
- No secrets or API keys in the repo. Use `.env.local` (gitignored) and say in the README which variables are needed.

### Motion

- Motion's own rules are in `.claude/skills/motion/` (read `best-practices/` before animating). This section is what this project adds.
- Tokens: durations and the easing curve in `lib/motion.ts`, the same curve as `ease-out-soft` in `app/globals.css`. Use them, don't invent new timings.
- Every animation shows a change of state, a relationship or feedback to an action. Nothing moves only to decorate. Small UI 150–300 ms, large surfaces up to ~500 ms.
- One moment per page: the thing the brief is really about gets the motion. Everything around it stays calm.
- Animate `transform` and `opacity` (and `clip-path`, `filter`). Use `layout` for size and position changes, `AnimatePresence` for exits, `<Reveal>` (`components/reveal.tsx`) for entrances on scroll. Hover, focus and simple colour changes stay in CSS (`transition-*` with `ease-out-soft`).
- Reduced motion: `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` in `components/providers.tsx` turns off Motion's movement and keeps fades. For CSS use `motion-safe:` / `motion-reduce:`. Anything custom (scroll-linked, loops, canvas) checks `useReducedMotion()` and has a still version.
- Smooth scroll (Lenis, `components/smooth-scroll.tsx`) is on for mouse and trackpad, off on touch and under reduced motion. Turn it off (`SMOOTH_SCROLL = false`) for tools, dashboards and forms. An element that scrolls on its own (a drawer, a long list) needs `data-lenis-prevent`.

### Examples to keep or delete

- `app/kit/` is the tokens page: every colour, type size, control and motion on one page. Tune the tokens there first. Delete it before hand-in unless it is kept on purpose as the design system page.
- `lib/cart/` is a typed basket (prices in whole øre, saved in the browser, in step across tabs). For a shop brief, wrap the app in `<CartProvider>` in `components/providers.tsx` and use `useCart()`. Otherwise delete the folder and the kit's basket.

### Every state, not just the happy path

Design and build loading, empty, error, offline and stale-data states for every view that shows data. Say what the user sees and can do in each one.

### Layout and accessibility

- Phone first: build and check at 390 px wide, then scale up with `sm:`/`md:`/`lg:`.
- Semantic HTML: one `h1` per page, landmarks (`main`, `nav`, `header`), real `button` and `a` elements, lists for lists.
- Every input has a visible label. Text and controls meet 4.5:1 contrast. Touch targets at least 44 px (`min-h-11`).
- Everything works with the keyboard, in a sensible order, with visible `focus-visible` rings.
- Live updates have screen reader text (`aria-live="polite"` or `role="status"`, `sr-only` where the visual is not text).
- Set `<html lang>` in `app/layout.tsx` to the UI's language (`da` for a Danish interface).

### Working with Olle

- Olle owns the idea, art direction and design; agents build. Ask before a design decision, don't make it silently.
- Log each decision as one line in README → Decisions as you go (what and why, in plain words).
- When asked, explain every file you wrote in plain words: what it does, why it is there and what would break without it.
- Keep the README sections filled in as the work moves, so it is ready to hand in at any moment.

### Before hand-in

1. README fits one screen: every section filled, Decisions cut to the 4–5 that matter, the "Before you start" section gone.
2. Unused examples deleted (`app/kit/`, `lib/cart/`), no leftover starter copy ("Starter" in `app/layout.tsx` metadata and `app/page.tsx`).
3. `npm run check` green, and the live link opens without a login.
4. Checked at 390 px and on desktop, with the keyboard, and with reduced motion on.
